                                state vs props
State - This is data maintained inside a component. It is local or owned by that
specific component. The component itself will update the state using the setState function.

Props - Data passed in from a parent component. props are read-only in the child 
component that receives them. However, callback functions can also be passed, 
which can be executed inside the child to initiate an update.
